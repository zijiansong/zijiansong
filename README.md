### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a PhD Candidate in theoretical condensed matter physics & quantum information at UC Davis. 

My research interests lie at the intersection between topological phases of matter and quantum error
correction. Specifically, I focus on 
(1) applying adaptive quantum circuits for preparing ground states of topological phases and conducting quantum computations, 
(2) exploring the structures and properties of random quantum circuits, and 
(3) investigating general properties of topological phases, including generalized symmetries, gauging dualities, and topological defects.
